# Airline Crew Scheduling with SA & BGA

This repository contains the implementation of **Simulated Annealing (SA)**, **Standard Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA)**, and an **Improved BGA** to solve airline crew scheduling problems.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to implement **three optimization algorithms** from scratch to solve set partitioning problems from the **OR-Library**. The algorithms include:
- **Simulated Annealing (SA)**
- **Standard Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA)**
- **Improved BGA** (with additional initialization, ranking, and refinement strategies)

We use **benchmark datasets** from OR-Library:
- `sppnw41.txt`
- `sppnw42.txt`
- `sppnw43.txt`

## 🔧 Implemented Features
✔️ **Simulated Annealing (SA)**  
✔️ **Standard Binary Genetic Algorithm (BGA)**  
✔️ **Improved BGA**, including:  
   - Pseudo-random initialization  
   - Stochastic ranking method for constraint handling  
   - Heuristic improvement operator
